# EDES 301 - Project 02: Etch-a-Sketch PCB
Made with help from Erik Welsh

A custom PCB designed for a PocketBeagle-based Etch-a-Sketch game. The board acts as a shield to interface the microcontroller with analog inputs, user buttons, and an SPI display.

* PocketBeagle (Mounted on bottom)
* Adafruit 2.8" TFT (SPI Interface)
* 2x Potentiometers (1.8V Analog logic)
* 2x Push Buttons (Active Low GPIO)
* 3x LEDs (Red, Green, Blue)
* USB Type-A Host Port
